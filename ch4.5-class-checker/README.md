It’s worth noting the diagnostic calls. The diagnostic message is constructed in Lines 20-22. Our diagnostic message accepts two parameters: the class name and the number of methods for the class. These parameters are encoded with the ’%1’ and ’%2’ placeholders in Line 22. The actual values for these parameters are passed in Line 25, where the diagnostic message is constructed using the DiagBuild object. This object is an instance of the clang::DiagnosticBuilder class, which implements the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) pattern. It emits the actual diagnostics upon its destruction.
